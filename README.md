## Why Fluentd?

Fluentd was chosen because it is:
- **Flexible & Scalable:** Supports many plugins and handles high-volume logs.
- **Easy to Integrate:** Works seamlessly with Docker's logging driver.
- Not a big fan of UI, so I excluded Graylog. Did not choose OpenSearch because itâ€™s more complex if you focus solely on logging. Finally, Fluentd was a better choice for this project than Filebeat for the first two reasons mentioned.
